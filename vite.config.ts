  // finish the async native-prefs restore BEFORE app-core's store evaluates
  // (loadPrefs caches on first call), and the only ordering Rollup
  // guarantees is the dynamic-import boundary bootstrap -> main. A named
  // manual chunk reachable through that boundary gets hoisted into the
  // entry's STATIC graph (same mechanism as the mermaid note below) and
  // evaluates before bootstrap runs — which is exactly how the 1.1.3
  // settings-restore silently raced and lost. Chunk naming bought nothing
  // on-device anyway: assets ship inside the APK, so there is no HTTP
  // cache for stable chunk hashes to help.

  // into the entry's STATIC graph — every launch then fetched and evaluated
  // 2.5MB of diagram code (plus vendor-markdown, which it imports) before the
  // user opened a note. Narrowing the rule does not help; the grouping itself
  // breaks the async boundary. Left to Rollup, mermaid lands in its own async
  // chunks fetched the first time a diagram actually renders. Total bundle
  // size is unchanged; only the boot path is — which is exactly what the
  // mobile cold-start budget cares about.
