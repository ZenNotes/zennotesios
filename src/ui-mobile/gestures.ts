/**
 * Configurable swipe gestures (issue #24, modelled on Obsidian mobile).
 *
 * The phone shell already had three touch gestures over an open note: a
 * left-edge swipe opens Browse, a horizontal flick moves to the previous /
 * next note, and a pinch resizes the font. The request was for the Obsidian
 * set — swipe to the file browser, swipe to the outline, pull down for a
 * quick action — and, since those collide with the flick, a setting to
 * choose. This module owns that setting: three slots (swipe left, swipe
 * right, pull down), each mapping to one action. Defaults keep the shipped
 * swipe behavior and turn the new pull-down on, where nothing else lived.
 *
 * Reads are cached: the gesture hooks consult the prefs on every touch and
 * the Settings card writes through `setGesturePrefs`, so a change applies to
 * the very next swipe without remounting anything.
